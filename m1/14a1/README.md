Hello, everyone!<br>
<br>
I've done a mock-up which you may view and comment on at the following link:<br>
https://xd.adobe.com/view/7c776d9e-8709-4b5f-7921-237f6bc1798a-0a46/grid<br>
I was not able to work the actual animation into the mock-up; could be my ability to work with XD, could be it's not in there.  So the paragraphs in the notes mostly describe the animation I will be aiming to do, but I've put any relevant notes regarding the site in that one artboard.<br>
<br>
This directory currently just contains mostly placeholders, possible images to use, and some empty less files.<br><br>
